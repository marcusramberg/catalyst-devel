=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Devel - Catalyst Development Tools

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Catalyst::Devel> package includes a variety of modules useful for the
development of Catalyst applications, but not required to run them. This
is intended to make it easier to deploy Catalyst apps. The runtime parts of
Catalyst are now known as C<Catalyst::Runtime>. 

C<Catalyst::Devel> includes the L<Catalyst::Helper> system, which
autogenerates scripts and tests; L<Module::Install::Catalyst>, a
L<Module::Install> extension for Catalyst; and requirements for a
variety of development-related modules. The documentation remains with
L<Catalyst::Runtime>.
